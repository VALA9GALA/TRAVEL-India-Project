            <h4>WHY INDIA?</h4>
            <h3>Riches of Past, Present and Future</h3>
            <p>
              I'm interested in bridging worlds between Old and New. India has a
              deep, rich history as a people and a nation, offers
              multitudes of diversity and extraordinary contrast to our Western
              way of life. I have travelled to Ancient sites around the World
              and am interested in travel to places rooted in History, but
              are emerging into a Renaissance. India is the epitome of this. It
              is one of the fastest growing economies and considered an
              Emerging Superpower, as well as being rooted in the most colorful
              and magical, mythical origins. The colors of dress, the aroma of
              curries steeping, the hustle and bustle of people piled up and
              squeezed on top of eachother-- it stretches the conceptual
              framework of what it means to be ALIVE. Sacred cows, mischevious
              monkeys... donkeys, camels, cats and dogs-- oh my! Just crossing
              the street is a death-defying stunt in Delhi. Being there is being
              totally immersed in The Moment. It's ELECTRIC!

                <h3>Rishikesh</h3>
                <p>
                  Rishikesh is a city along the sacred Ganges River at the
                  Foothills of the Himalayas. It is a pilgramage town for Hindus
                  and is considered "The Yoga Capital of The World." Tourists,
                  yogis and seekers from every corner flock here.

                <h5>What I like:</h5>
                <p>
                  I like strolling through the winding, cobblestone streets
                  here. It is nested in the valley of the Himalayas, so it has
                  an enclosed, enclave vibe. Crossing the two pedestrian bridges
                  over the Ganges is an exhilarating experience as they sway in
                  the mountain breeze. There are many temples, ashrams, markets,
                  MONKEYS and COWS.

                <p>
                  Vrindavan is an important city for the Hindu faith. It is said
                  that Krishna spent most of his childhood here. It is a revered
                  pilgrimage site and hosts more than 5,000 temples to worship
                  Krishna and his feminine counterpart, Radha.

                  You can get chai in the streets here, as there are many

                  Sri Sri Krishna Balaram Mandir Temple (ISKCON Temple), one of
                  the main temples built for Krishna. You can stay at MVT

              Hi! My name is Val and I'm a -MAKER- and FE DEVELOPER based in
              NYC, with a passion for TRAVEL! I went to India a few years ago on
              a tour for the Festival of Colors, known as HOLI. It was a
              life-changing experience-- total sensory overload! One of my fave
              places I've been so far. Everyone should go and take in all the
              extraordinary sites, smells and sounds.
